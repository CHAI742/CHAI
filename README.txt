CHAI Foundation static site
--------------------------------
Files:
- index.html, about.html, projects.html, get-involved.html, donate.html, contact.html, privacy.html, 404.html
- assets/css/styles.css
- assets/js/main.js
- assets/img/* (placeholders: replace with real images)

How to use:
1) Open index.html to preview locally.
2) For GitHub Pages: create a repo and push these files to the root (or /docs with Pages pointing to /docs). Ensure index.html is present.
3) Replace the placeholder images in assets/img with your photos (keep the same filenames), or update the <img src> paths.
4) Connect the contact form to a backend (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms) by changing the form 'action'.
5) Customize copy, numbers, and partners as you grow.
